GTV is a library for the manipulation of tetrahedralized volumes,
based on dynamic Delaunay tetrahedralization of sets of vertices. It
is installed using a standard GNU autoconf script, so it should require
no more than:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

You will need to have the GNU Triangulated Surface (GTS) library
installed. You can get it from

http://gts.sourceforge.net/

Type ./configure --help for more information on options and on where
things are installed.

This will place the libraries and some executables in standard
places. HTML documentation, generated using doxygen, will be installed
in ${prefix}/..../doc/gtv/html. This will give you an idea of how to
use the library, and you can also study the source code of the
programs in the tools subdirectory. A LaTeX version of the
documentation is in doc/latex and a PDF can be generated by typing
`make'.
