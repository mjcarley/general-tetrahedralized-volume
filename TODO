A function to generate an equilateral tetrahedron enclosing a list of vertices.

Generate quality statistics including quality measures for tetrahedra.

Allow for user-specified near-field calculation functions based on
list of tetrahedra in an octtree box.

Implement ray-tracing and Suh/Newman type quadrature methods for near
field calculations.
